Hines, M.L. and Carnevale, N.T. NEURON: a tool for neuroscientists.
The Neuroscientist 7:123-135, 2001.

The value of Ra for figures 3,4,5 is 160 instead of the 180 stated in the
paper.

In fig 9 the dt plot can vary in details from the figure due to
changes in implementation and cvode upgrades. A value of 1e-10 is added
to dt before taking the log10 because dt=0 at stimulus discontinuities.
Also we display the order used by cvode as a function of time.

Usage notes:

On all platforms:

This model has been verified under NEURON 5.7.159 on mswin
unix and mac platforms.  The radio buttons for Figs. 1-8 generate the 
corresponding figures automatically.  Figure 9 actually requires a 
click on Init & Run (e.g. so users can explore effects of changing 
absolute tolerance),

mswin: Auto-launch (ModelDB) or download and extract the zip file.
Then double click on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

unix: Auto-launch, or download and extract the archive.  Then type 
nrngui mosinit.hoc
at the command line after cd'ing to the hines2001 directory.

mac OS X: Download the archive.  Drag and drop the archive on the mos2nrn 
icon in the Neuron application directory.

The channel information for Fig. 9 is the same as Mainen & Sejnowski
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=2488
and the cell type is Neocortical pyramidal neuron: deep
The cell for Figs. 7 and 8 is a Dentate granule cell.
